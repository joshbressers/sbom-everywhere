[DaggerBoard](https://github.com/nyph-infosec/daggerboard) is a vulnerability scanning tool designed to process Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) files (CycloneDX, SPDX) and present the results in an easy-to-understand format. This tool assesses the software dependencies listed in the SBOM file for potential vulnerabilities. Much like a daggerboard stabilizes a ship, the DaggerBoard application helps your organization stay secure by analyzing and managing risk levels.
